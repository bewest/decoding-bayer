Dear Mr. West,

This is a follow up e-mail regarding the e-mail you sent yesterday.  I understand you requested for documentation for the communication protocols for all Bayer meters.

Please click on this link to view the documentation: http://userportal.iha.dk/~jrt/BayerContour/MeterInterface.pdf. This is also applicable to the Bayer Contour USB meter.

The brand name we are currently using is changed from "Ascensia" to "Bayer" but the product, design, and integrity remain unchanged.

For more information, please feel free to contact one of our customer service representatives by calling 1-800-348-8100.  Our representatives are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to resolve any product problems.

We are committed to helping you simplify your life with Diabetes.

Sincerely,

Bayer HealthCare, Customer Service

Greetings,

Lifescan publishes the communication protocol for their meters, but
I'm having trouble finding documentation for the communication
protocols needed to access the data on the Bayer Countour Meter.

Can someone please provide the communication protocol?  It's critical
for patients to be able to access their own data directly from the
device.

Thanks,
Ben West
